                  Since 20 August 2024, heavy rainfall combined with the release
                  of water from upstream in India has triggered severe flooding
                  in several districts of Bangladesh, including Feni, Noakhali,
                  Comilla, Lakshmipur, Brahmanbaria, Cox's Bazar, Khagrachhari,
                  Chattogram, Habiganj, and Moulvibazar.The sudden floods have
                  resulted in the deaths of 13 people, including two women.
                  Among the deceased, four died in Cumilla, one in Feni, four in
                  Chattogram, one in Noakhali, one in Brahmanbaria, one in
                  Lakshmipur, and four in Cox’s Bazar.

                  The death toll in the recent flash floods in Feni has risen to
                  23, according to district administration sources as of Friday
                  night. The floods, caused by the upwelling of water from India
                  and heavy rains, have submerged six upazilas, leaving hundreds
                  of thousands of people stranded. The first fatality was
                  reported on the night of August 24, when locals discovered a
                  body floating in knee-deep water in front of Sonali Bank on
                  Mizan Road in Feni.

                  Six deaths were reported in the Comilla district in the last
                  three days due to continuous rain and worsening flood
                  situation. The flood situation in Comilla on Thursday worsened
                  as the water level in the Gomti River rose due to heavy
                  rainfall and inflow from upstream. The deaths occurred in
                  various areas including Salahuddin intersection in Comilla
                  city, Laksham, Chauddagram, and Nangalkot upazilas. Among

                  Tuesday.

                <p class="py-6">
                  On 15 July 2024, students of Dhaka University were sitting
                  with placards and flags in a peaceful protest calling for
                  reforms on the quota allocation for government jobs in
                  Bangladesh. Suddenly, they were attacked by individuals armed
                  with rods, sticks and clubs with a few even brandishing
                  revolvers. Within hours, a pattern emerged across the country
                  with similar attacks coordinated by people believed to be
                  members of the Bangladesh Chatra League (BCL), a group
                  affiliated with the ruling Awami League (AL), against student
                  protesters.

                <p class="py-6">
                  Abu Sayed, a student of English at the Rangpur’s Begum Rokeya
                  University, stood his ground. As the police closed in, he
                  spread his arms wide open, in a moment of defiance. In a
                  seemingly intentional and unjustifiable attack, the police
                  fired directly at his chest. At least two police officers
                  discharged 12-gauge shotguns directly towards him from across
                  the street – a distance of merely 15 meters. Sayed clutched
                  his chest on impact as officers fired at least two more times
                  using birdshot, ammunition that is designed for hunting which
                  is extremely dangerous, inherently inaccurate and thus
                  unlawful for use in the policing of protests. Sayed posed no
                  apparent physical threat to the police.
